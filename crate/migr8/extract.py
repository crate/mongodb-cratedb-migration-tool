""" Exports a schema definition from a MongoDB collection.

This will iterate over a collection (either totally, or partially) and build
up a description of the schema of the MongoDB collection.

Within the schema, each field in the collection will be described with two
fields:

- "count", being the number of entries in the collection that have this field.
- "types", being the types present for those entries.

For each type in a field's types, it will have a count that signifies the number
of entries of that field with that data type. If it is an object, it will also
contain a schema of the object's types. If it is an array, it will contain
a list of types that are present in the arrays, as well as their counts.

An example schema may look like:

{
    "count": 10,
    "document": {
        "ts": {
            "count": 10,
            "types": {"DATETIME": {"count": 10}
            }
        },
        "payload": {
            "count": 10,
            "types": {
                "OBJECT": {
                    "count": 10,
                    "document": {
                        "temp": {
                            "count": 10,
                            "types": {"FLOAT": {"count": 4}, "INTEGER": {"count": 6}}
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
